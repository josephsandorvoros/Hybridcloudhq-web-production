<p>It’s been a while since I’ve added anything here. I haven’t forgotten this space, I’ve just been busy leveling up my skills, working hard, and yes, sneaking in some video games. The past few months have been packed, but recently I had the chance to attend Microsoft Ignite for the very first time. And let me tell you, it was awesome.</p>
<p>Now, I should get this out of the way… #IWORKFORDELL. This wasn’t just a fun trip, between Dell and Microsoft my attendance was covered. That said, what follows is simply my open and honest take on the experience.</p>
<h1>The Atmosphere</h1>
<p>First off, it was busy. I heard the number was north of 20,000 attendees, and you could feel the energy of that many people packed into one place. Yet, everything was impressively well run. Lines moved quickly, sessions were organized, and the whole event had a smooth rhythm. Between sponsor booths, breakout sessions, and hands-on labs, the hardest part was deciding what to see and do… there was just so much happening at once.</p>
<h1>The Announcements</h1>
<p>There were so many announcements that it’s tough to keep track. As expected, AI was front and center… but it’s not just hype anymore, it’s getting genuinely better.</p>
<p>That hit home for me because I’ve been building my own local AI setup (still owe you that tutorial). I’ve been experimenting with tweaks to make it more effective, like installing continue.dev in VS Code. It’s a fantastic extension, it works with cloud providers out of the box, but also hooks into ollama, letting me switch between models and even use a Manager Agent to delegate tasks. I’ve been exploring how to bring this into Open WebUI, probably with pipelines, workflows, and maybe some N8N integrations.</p>
<p>Watching the keynote, sitting front and center, it struck me that Microsoft has essentially built this into Copilot by default. It now integrates seamlessly across Office apps, and in Azure agents can manage drift, settings, optimizations, and even Azure plus ARC-enabled workloads (in Public Cloud or on prem). It’s downright cool. Thinking about the time savings and capabilities this unlocks for tech teams and for everyday workers, it’s hard not to get excited.</p>
<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
<p>I’m not going to try to cover every announcement here, there were too many. Instead, I’ll drop the link to the official <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2025-book-of-news/">Ignite 2025 Book of News</a> so you can explore them yourself.</p>
<p>If Ignite 2025 showed anything, it’s that AI is moving from experiment to everyday tool.</p>
<p>That’s all for now…</p>
<p>Cheers, and be awesome!</p>
