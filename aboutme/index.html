      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi — I'm the author of Hybridcloudhq. I am learning the practical application of the designs and concepts I have been selling for years. My goal is to write practical guides, give honest openions and advice and publish projects to help people in their own journeys.</p>
<h1>Joseph Sándor Voros</h1>
<p>I’m interested in ... my family, computer games, woodworking (or at least trying), music, art, tattoos, camping, bartending, ax throwing etc.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning ... AI, containerization (for now mainly docker and its ilk), Azure Local, Azure, brushing up on and learning networking, dipping my toe into Python and PowerShell. I am also learning Git and now how to have a website, so forgive me for the rough appearance here.</p>
<p>I have skills in ... sound engineering, infrastructure design, hyper-converged infrastructure (lots of flavors), Common Orchestration, Automation, Governance, and Security (C.O.A.G.S) in both theory and design.</p>
<h1>What am I hoping to get out of this?</h1>
<p>I really just want to get better at doing any number of things, and I want a place to land that knowledge. Some of it will be in various tools I use, but I also want to potentially be able to share some here. If I can help anyone who may be struggling with something I have, or even help offer some thoughts on  what I have seen and what works from the hardware perspective.</p>
<h1>Why am I qualified to doll out advice?</h1>
<p>Well at this point in my carrier I think I have some things to share. Also by no means do I believe I am the most qualified, and there is just always so much to learn, but I have been in tech sales for a while now and if I can help anyone with my knowledge I am happy to, and if I am learning a new thing, I might as well share that as well. Also I need to say this in at least one place here (and likely more)...I work for Dell. I am not here to sell anything or make vendor recommendations, but since I will be exploring and talking about things I know I need to say that at least. Below is an honest list of my experience in tech sales and this can be found on my linkedin as well.</p>
